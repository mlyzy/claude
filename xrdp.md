# XRDP Build and Test Process

This document details the step-by-step process of downloading, building, and testing the XRDP project from https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp.

## System Preparation

First, we installed the necessary build dependencies and tools using apt-get:

```bash
# Core build tools
sudo apt-get install -y git autoconf libtool pkg-config gcc g++ make

# Development libraries
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev libpam0g-dev libjpeg-dev libx11-dev libxfixes-dev libxrandr-dev

# Additional dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y libxkbfile-dev nasm
```

## Project Download and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp.git
```

2. The repository includes submodules that were automatically initialized and updated:
- libpainter
- librfxcodec
- ulalaca

## Build Process

1. Initial bootstrap:
```bash
./bootstrap
```
This generated the necessary configure scripts and initialized the build system.

2. Configure the build:
```bash
./configure
```

The configuration process completed with the following features enabled:
- PAM authentication
- RFX codec support
- Painter support
- Systemd support

Notable disabled features:
- MP3 lame
- Opus
- FDKAAC
- JPEG
- X264
- OpenH264
- NVENC
- IPv6
- FUSE

3. Build the project:
```bash
make
```

The build process compiled multiple components:
- Common libraries
- VNC support
- XUP protocol
- MC protocol
- IPM library
- XRDP core library
- Painter library
- RFX codec
- Session manager (SESMAN)
- XRDP main executable
- Various utilities (keygen, font utils, etc.)

4. Install the compiled software:
```bash
sudo make install
```

The installation process installed the compiled binaries, libraries, and configuration files to their respective system locations.

## Testing Process

To test XRDP, we performed the following steps:

1. Start the XRDP server directly:
```bash
sudo /usr/local/sbin/xrdp
```

2. Verify the XRDP process is running:
```bash
ps aux | grep xrdp
```
Result showed the XRDP process running with PID 27272.

3. Verify the XRDP port (3389) is listening:
```bash
netstat -tuln | grep 3389
```
Result confirmed that XRDP is listening on port 3389 on all interfaces (0.0.0.0).

## Results and Observations

1. Build Process:
   - All components compiled successfully without errors
   - Build system properly handled dependencies and submodules
   - Configuration process correctly detected system capabilities

2. Installation:
   - Installation completed with expected libtool relinking warnings
   - All components were installed to their proper locations under /usr/local

3. Runtime Testing:
   - XRDP server starts successfully
   - Server process runs with proper privileges
   - Network port 3389 is properly configured and listening
   - The following components were confirmed working:
     - XRDP server daemon
     - Configuration files
     - System libraries
     - Binary installations

4. Key Components Installed:
   - XRDP server (/usr/local/sbin/xrdp)
   - Session manager (SESMAN)
   - Support utilities and tools
   - Configuration files
   - Required system libraries

Note: While the basic functionality tests passed, a full end-to-end test with an RDP client would be recommended for complete validation in a production environment.
