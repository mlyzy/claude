# Starlette Project Testing Process

This document describes the process of downloading, installing, and testing the Starlette web framework project.

## 1. Project Setup

### Clone Repository
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/starlette_test && cd /tmp/starlette_test
git clone https://github.com/encode/starlette.git
cd starlette
```

This command:
- Creates a new directory for testing
- Clones the Starlette repository
- Changes to the project directory

### Environment Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

This creates and activates a virtual environment for isolated testing.

## 2. Install Dependencies

### Install Project
```bash
pip install -e ".[full]"
```

This command:
- Installs Starlette in editable mode
- Includes all optional dependencies with the [full] option
- Sets up the package for development

### Install Test Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

This installs:
- All project requirements from requirements.txt
- pytest for running tests
- pytest-cov for test coverage reporting

## 3. Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Test Results
- Total tests: 913
- Passed: 911
- xfailed: 2
- Execution time: 8.87s

The test suite shows excellent results with all tests either passing or having expected failures (xfailed).

## 4. Dependencies Overview

Major dependencies installed include:
- anyio: Asynchronous I/O library
- httpx: HTTP client library
- jinja2: Template engine
- python-multipart: Multipart form data parsing
