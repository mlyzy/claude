# Webview Project Installation and Testing Process

## Overview
This document describes the attempted process of installing, building, and testing the webview project from https://github.com/webview/webview. The webview project is a tiny cross-platform webview library to build modern cross-platform GUIs using web technologies.

## System Requirements
The webview project requires the following dependencies:
- build-essential
- pkg-config
- gcc/g++
- GTK+3
- WebKit2GTK

## Installation Attempts and Challenges

### 1. Repository Clone
```bash
cd /tmp
mkdir webview_test
cd webview_test
git clone https://github.com/webview/webview.git
```
**Purpose**: Create a working directory and clone the webview repository
**Result**: Repository was successfully cloned to local machine

### 2. Dependencies Installation Attempts
```bash
# First attempt
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config gcc g++ gtk+-3.0 webkit2gtk-4.0 libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev

# Second attempt with --fix-missing
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y --fix-missing build-essential pkg-config gcc g++ gtk+-3.0 webkit2gtk-4.0 libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev

# Third attempt with alternative mirror
sudo sed -i 's/archive.ubuntu.com/mirrors.edge.kernel.org/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y --fix-missing build-essential pkg-config gcc g++ gtk+-3.0 webkit2gtk-4.0 libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
```
**Purpose**: Install required system dependencies
**Result**: Encountered persistent package management issues:
- Package repository connectivity problems
- Unmet dependencies
- System package manager locks

### 3. System Recovery Attempts
```bash
# Attempt to fix package management system
sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock*
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
```
**Purpose**: Resolve package management system issues
**Result**: Unable to complete package installation due to system timeouts

## Current Status and Next Steps

The installation process is currently blocked by system-level package management issues. To proceed with testing the webview project, the following steps need to be resolved:

1. System Package Management:
   - Resolve package repository connectivity issues
   - Clear and reset package management system
   - Ensure all required dependencies can be installed

2. Build Process (Pending):
   - Compile example programs
   - Run test suite
   - Document build output and test results

3. Testing (Pending):
   - Test basic functionality
   - Test example applications
   - Document behavior and performance

## Recommendations

1. Consider using a fresh system installation to avoid package management conflicts
2. Try alternative package sources or offline package installation
3. Consider building dependencies from source if package management issues persist

## Project Information
The webview project aims to provide a lightweight cross-platform webview interface for building GUI applications. While we encountered system-level issues during our installation attempt, the project itself remains a valuable tool for creating modern cross-platform applications using web technologies.
