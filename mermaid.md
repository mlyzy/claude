# Mermaid.js Installation and Testing Process

## Environment Setup

1. Created working directory:
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/mermaid-test && cd /tmp/mermaid-test
```

2. Cloned the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid.git
cd mermaid
```

## Node.js Installation

1. Attempted multiple Node.js installation methods, finally succeeded with nvm:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

## Project Dependencies

1. Installed pnpm package manager:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Installed project dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Build Process

1. Built the project:
```bash
pnpm run build
```

The build process generated multiple output files across different packages:

### Parser Package
- Generated core, ESM, and minified versions
- Files included parsing definitions for different diagram types
- Build outputs include source maps

### Main Mermaid Package
- Generated multiple bundle formats:
  - mermaid.js (6.0MB)
  - mermaid.min.js (2.6MB)
  - mermaid.tiny.min.js (1.6MB)
- Created separate chunks for each diagram type
- Included source maps for debugging

### Example Diagram Package
- Generated core and ESM versions
- Included diagram definition files
- Created minified versions with source maps

### ZenUML Package
- Generated multiple formats including core and ESM
- Created chunked files for different components
- Included style panels and UI elements

### Layout ELK Package
- Generated core and ESM versions
- Created render-specific chunks
- Included source maps for debugging

## Build Results Analysis

### Main Bundle Sizes
- Full bundle (mermaid.js): 6.0MB
- Minified bundle (mermaid.min.js): 2.6MB
- Tiny minified bundle (mermaid.tiny.min.js): 1.6MB

### Notable Components
1. Core Components:
   - Sequence Diagrams
   - Block Diagrams
   - Flow Diagrams
   - C4 Diagrams
   - Gantt Charts
   - Git Graphs

2. Specialized Diagrams:
   - Architecture Diagrams
   - Mindmap Diagrams
   - XY Charts
   - ER Diagrams
   - Timeline Diagrams
   - Journey Diagrams

### Build Warnings
- Several packages showed warnings about unsupported engine requirements
- Some deprecated package warnings were encountered
- Multiple assignments warnings in language definition files

## Note on Testing
The test suite execution was attempted but timed out after 3600 seconds. This might indicate either:
- Very comprehensive test coverage
- Potential performance issues in the test suite
- System resource limitations

## Conclusion
The build process successfully generated all necessary files and bundles, with proper minification and source map generation. The project maintains a modular structure with separate packages for different functionalities. While the bundle sizes are relatively large, the availability of a tiny minified version (1.6MB) provides an option for size-conscious applications.
