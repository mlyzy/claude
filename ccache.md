# CCache Installation and Testing Process

This document describes the step-by-step process of building and testing CCache from source code.

## 1. Environment Setup

### 1.1 Working Directory Creation
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/ccache_build && cd /tmp/ccache_build
```
**Purpose**: Create a dedicated directory for building ccache
**Result**: Created directory `/tmp/ccache_build`

### 1.2 Repository Cloning
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccache/ccache.git .
```
**Purpose**: Download the ccache source code
**Result**: Successfully cloned the repository into the current directory

### 1.3 Dependencies Installation
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y cmake build-essential zstd libzstd-dev ninja-build python3-pip
```
**Purpose**: Install required build tools and libraries
**Content**:
- cmake: Build system generator
- build-essential: Essential compilation tools
- zstd and libzstd-dev: Compression library and development files
- ninja-build: Build system implementation
- python3-pip: Python package manager

## 2. Build Configuration

### 2.1 Create Build Directory
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```
**Purpose**: Create a separate build directory for out-of-source build
**Result**: Created and entered build directory

### 2.2 Configure Build
```bash
cmake -G Ninja ..
```
**Purpose**: Generate build files using CMake with Ninja generator
**Result**: Successfully generated build configuration
**Note**: Documentation generation was disabled due to missing asciidoctor

## 3. Building Process

### 3.1 Compilation
```bash
ninja
```
**Purpose**: Compile the entire project
**Content**: The build process included:
- Compiling ASM files for BLAKE3 hashing
- Building C/C++ source files
- Linking static libraries
- Building unit tests
**Result**: Successfully built:
- ccache executable
- test-lockfile executable
- unittest executable

## 4. Testing

### 4.1 Running Tests
```bash
ctest --output-on-failure
```
**Purpose**: Run the test suite
**Content**: Executed 48 tests including:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Feature-specific tests

**Results Summary**:
- Total tests: 48
- Passed tests: 32
- Skipped tests: 16
- Failed tests: 0
- Total test time: 41.37 seconds

### 4.2 Notable Test Categories
1. **Core Functionality Tests**:
   - Base functionality
   - Cache levels
   - Configuration
   - Direct mode
   - Dependency handling

2. **Feature-Specific Tests**:
   - Compression handling
   - Debug information handling
   - Hardlinking
   - Namespace isolation
   - PCH (Precompiled Headers)

3. **Remote Storage Tests**:
   - File-based remote storage
   - HTTP-based remote storage
   - URL handling

4. **Compiler-Specific Tests**:
   - GCC profiling
   - Multi-architecture support
   - Source date epoch handling

### 4.3 Skipped Tests
Several tests were skipped due to missing dependencies or platform-specific features:
- NVCC-related tests (CUDA compiler)
- Redis storage tests
- Clang-specific tests
- Debug compilation tests
- Module-related tests

## 5. Final Status

The build and test process completed successfully with all executed tests passing. The project is ready for use with basic functionality, though some advanced features may require additional dependencies for full functionality.
